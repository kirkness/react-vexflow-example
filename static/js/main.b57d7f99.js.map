The algorithm can align multiple voices both\n\t\t// within a stave, and across multiple staves.\n\t\t//\n\t\t// To do this, the formatter breaks up voices into a grid of rational-valued\n\t\t// `ticks`, to which each note is assigned. Then, minimum widths are assigned\n\t\t// to each tick based on the widths of the notes and modifiers in that tick. This\n\t\t// establishes the smallest amount of space required for each tick.\n\t\t//\n\t\t// Finally, the formatter distributes the left over space proportionally to\n\t\t// all the ticks, setting the `x` values of the notes in each tick.\n\t\t//\n\t\t// See `tests/formatter_tests.js` for usage examples. The helper functions included\n\t\t// here (`FormatAndDraw`, `FormatAndDrawTab`) also serve as useful usage examples.\n\t\t\n\t\tvar _vex = __webpack_require__(1);\n\t\t\n\t\tvar _tables = __webpack_require__(2);\n\t\t\n\t\tvar _fraction = __webpack_require__(3);\n\t\t\n\t\tvar _voice = __webpack_require__(13);\n\t\t\n\t\tvar _beam = __webpack_require__(14);\n\t\t\n\t\tvar _staveconnector = __webpack_require__(17);\n\t\t\n\t\tvar _stavenote = __webpack_require__(18);\n\t\t\n\t\tvar _modifiercontext = __webpack_require__(25);\n\t\t\n\t\tvar _tickcontext = __webpack_require__(36);\n\t\t\n\t\tfunction _classCallCheck(instance, Constructor) { if (!(instance instanceof Constructor)) { throw new TypeError(\"Cannot call a class as a function\"); } }\n\t\t\n\t\t// To enable logging for this class.

The algorithm can align multiple voices both\n\t// within a stave, and across multiple staves.\n\t//\n\t// To do this, the formatter breaks up voices into a grid of rational-valued\n\t// `ticks`, to which each note is assigned. Then, minimum widths are assigned\n\t// to each tick based on the widths of the notes and modifiers in that tick. This\n\t// establishes the smallest amount of space required for each tick.\n\t//\n\t// Finally, the formatter distributes the left over space proportionally to\n\t// all the ticks, setting the `x` values of the notes in each tick.\n\t//\n\t// See `tests/formatter_tests.js` for usage examples. The helper functions included\n\t// here (`FormatAndDraw`, `FormatAndDrawTab`) also serve as useful usage examples.\n\t\n\tvar _vex = __webpack_require__(1);\n\t\n\tvar _tables = __webpack_require__(2);\n\t\n\tvar _fraction = __webpack_require__(3);\n\t\n\tvar _voice = __webpack_require__(13);\n\t\n\tvar _beam = __webpack_require__(14);\n\t\n\tvar _staveconnector = __webpack_require__(17);\n\t\n\tvar _stavenote = __webpack_require__(18);\n\t\n\tvar _modifiercontext = __webpack_require__(25);\n\t\n\tvar _tickcontext = __webpack_require__(36);\n\t\n\tfunction _classCallCheck(instance, Constructor) { if (!(instance instanceof Constructor)) { throw new TypeError(\"Cannot call a class as a function\"); } }\n\t\n\t// To enable logging for this class.
